## Showcase

> Showcase is an Android application for displaying pictures. You can customize the source of pictures. Now it supports FTP, SFTP, SMB, and Webdav protocols. you can also configure the style of picture display.

### Source of inspiration


I like the picture wall screensaver of the mac computer very much. The screen saver of the mac can be configured with a folder, and then the pictures will be displayed on the picture wall.

At the same time, there are some old Android devices at home, and I have always wanted to use these idle devices as electronic photo albums. 

I'm an Android engineer and I just wanted to combine these two ideas. So I made this app and called it `Showcase`.

In Showcase, you can configure the image source, which can be a local folder or some shared file protocols, such as SMB, FTP, SFTP, WebDav.

Of course I'm adding more support for network storage like Google Grive, OneDrive, DropBox...

In addition, I also added the movie poster data source TMDB, you can choose to display the posters of current or upcoming movies.

In the future, I will add more image source support, and even support for video. And add more styles to display pictures.

Here is a preview of the app:
